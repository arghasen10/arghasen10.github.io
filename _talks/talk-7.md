 This poster presents the design, development, and test results of an energy consumption analysis module developed over ns3 Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communication, which can analyze the power consumption characteristics of 5G eNodeB/gNodeB Base Stations. This module is essential for research and exploration of the energy consumption behavior of the 5G communication protocols under the New Radio (NR) technology. To the best of our knowledge, the designed module is the first of its kind that provides a comprehensive energy analysis for the 5G mmWave base stations.
