This poster presents the design, development and test results of an energy consumption analysis module developed over ns3 Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communication for analyzing power consumption for 5G New Radio (NR) User Equipment (UE) during both continuous and discontinuous packet receptions. This module is important to analyze and explore the energy consumption behavior of the 5G communication protocols under the NR technology. The developed module includes the complete Radio Resource Control (RRC) state machine for 5G NR recommended by 3GPP Specification 38.840. To the best of our knowledge, the designed module is the first of its kind that provides a comprehensive energy analysis for the 5G NR UEs over mmWave communication.
