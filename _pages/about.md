I am currently a research scholar in the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/) at IIT Kharagpur, West Bengal. I am pursuing my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. [Sandip Chakraborty](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/). I am also a member of the research group [Ubiquitous Networked Systems Lab (UbiNet)](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/resgrp/ubinet/). 

<!-- Moreover, as a Visiting Postgraduate Research Student at the esteemed School of Computing and Information Systems at Singapore Management University ([SMU](https://www.smu.edu.sg/)), I am engaged in research work within the dynamic domain of the Human-Machine Collaborative Systems LAB, collaborating closely with [Prof. Archan Misra](https://sites.google.com/view/archan-misra) and [Prof. Thivya Kandappu](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/thivya-kandappu-541). -->

My research interests include the areas of Millimeter Wave Sensing, FMCW Radars, HCI, Next generation cellular networks, Embedded systems, IoT, UAV, etc.


Primary Research Experience
======
1. Experience with mmWave and acoustic FMCW signal processing techniques. I have used mmWave and accoustic FMCW  sensors for localization, tracking and activity recognition of humans under indoor environments.
1. Hands-on experience in hardware prototyping including circuit design, circuit debugging, deployment. Developed prototype hardwares for Embedded Pollution Sensors mounted on a drone for air quality assesment. 
1. Experience conducting human research studies. Conducted real-time driver inattenviness study using COTS mmWave Radars by collecting doppler shifts in the mmWave data because of drivers attentive body movements, such as talking, yawning, nodding, etc. 
1. Experience with design of UAVs, control systems, RF communication devices. Developed drones using ArduCopter APM flight controller board and mounted air quality measurement sensors.
1. Experience with Computer Networks, IoT devices, Distributed Sensor Networks. Worked on energy optimisation in 5G Cellular Networks, using network simulator ns-3.
